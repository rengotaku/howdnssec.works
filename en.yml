  title: "About Our DNSSEC Comic: A quirky peek behind the scenes at DNSimple"
  description: "Discover how DNSSEC, tacos, and a dash of teenage-level moodiness come together in our comic. Meet the DNSimple team, learn why DNSSEC matters, and enjoy an entertaining spin on secure domains."
  1: "Welcome to our DNSSEC comic's 'About' page. You might notice there's no fancy background gradient here, but that's all part of the charm. We like to keep things real (and occasionally sprinkle in some teenage-level moodiness for fun)."
  2: "Why this comic?"
  3: "Because DNSSEC is a big deal. It's complicated, but it doesn't have to be boring. We want to demystify it in the most entertaining way possible, complete with quirky jokes (we're not biased or anything), tacos, and a healthy disregard for plain-vanilla presentations."
  4: "Who's behind it?"
  5: "This project comes from the fine folks at DNSimple. We sell domains and keep them running smoothly. Think of us as DNS by people who get it. We've been a 100% remote team since 2010, scattered across Europe, Asia, and the Americas, yet perfectly synced in our love of tacos…and DNSSEC."
  6: "What else do we do?"
  7: "We offer SSL certificates and an API that's rock-solid (not our words, we swear!). That way you can automate and manage your domains, taco in one hand, keyboard in the other. Why waste precious taco time fiddling with DNSSEC?"
  8: "Anyway…"
  9: "Thanks for stopping by! Enjoy the comic, learn a bit, laugh a lot, and definitely grab some tortillas on your way out. Got the salsa handy?"

  title: "DNSSEC 101: why do we need DNSSEC?"
  description: "Discover how DNSSEC helps prevent tampering by verifying DNS responses. Learn why it's crucial for secure web navigation, plus get a refresher on resolvers and authoritative servers."
  1: "Good question! Why do we need DNSSEC?"
  2: "DNS was created the Internet was tiny small."
  3: "Security was not a primary concern in its design."
  4: "Simply put, DNS main job is to translate human-friendly names to IP addresses needed by your laptop, phones, and other network devices."
  5: "DNS is like a big phone book that your devices use to fetch you a website, or deliver your emails."
  6: "**DNS resolvers** are the ones in charge of tracking down this information for you."
  7: "And that data is often provided by **authoritative servers**."
  8: "But DNS resolvers have no way to verify the authenticity of a response from an authoritative server."
  9: "What if the response has been tampered with?"
  10: "This is where **DNSSEC** comes in."
  11: "Resolvers? Authoritative name servers? What are all these things? Check out <a href='https://howdns.works' target='_blank'>**HowDNS.works**</a> for a refresher and come back here."
  12: "I'll be waiting."
  13: "DNSSEC is short for Domain Name System Security Extensions."
  14: "Like HTTPS, DNSSEC provides a layer of security by allowing authenticated answers on top of DNS."
  15: "However, there is a important difference."
  16: "HTTPS encrypts traffic so no crabs can spy on your data."
  17: "**DNSSEC signs DNS data** to detect that no crabs have been messing with your DNS responses."
  18: "Bad crab. Bad."
  19: "DNSSEC doesn't include full encryption like HTTPS does."
  20: "The data is not kept confidential and secret between the resolver and the authoritative server."
  21: "Let's dig a bit deeper into DNSSEC. Ready?"

ep2:
  title: "DNSSEC Essentials: How RRSets, RRSIG, and DNSKEY Work Together"
  description: "Explore how DNSSEC secures DNS data using RRSets, zone-signing keys, and resource record signatures. Learn about private/public key pairs, hashing, and how resolvers verify authenticity."
  1: "To validate the authenticity of the DNS data, DNSSEC introduces a small number of new DNS record types."
  2: "The first thing that your DNS provider is going to do when you configure your domain with DNSSEC is to bundle all records into **RRsets**."
  3: "The RR in RRsets stands for resource records. A fancy way to say 'records of the same type and name' for a zone or domain."
  4: "RRsets bundle all records of the same type and name into a group that is digitally signed."
  5: "In the physical world, humans use signatures to bind the identity and authenticity of a message."
  6: "The same analogy can be carried out in the DNSSEC world."
  7: "The authoritative server signs each RRset with a **zone-signing key pair**."
  8: "We'll be talking about more keys later, so remember these keys are used to produce and verify a signature on the zone records."
  9: "Every zone-signing key has a **private** and **public** key pair. This is the basis of asymmetric cryptography."
  10: "Private and public keys work together. Data encrypted with the private key can be decrypted or validated with the public key."
  11: "The public key can be shared with anyone. It's public, and available to everyone."
  12-1: "Private keys are &mdash; you guessed it, private and shouldn't be shared."
  12-2: "Don't let the crabs get these!"
  13: "Together these two keys provide two important features!"
  14-1: "**One**: Verify that the content comes from the right source."
  14-2: "**Two**: Verify that the content hasn't been altered since it was sent."
  15: "These keys aren't used to encrypt the entire content of the records. Instead, a digital signature is produced by taking a portion of the RRSet, hashing it and encrypting it."
  16-1: "The hashing process is not just relevant for validation purposes."
  16-2: "Hashing reduces the size of the content to be sent, making the signature a fixed length."
  17: "This is important because we want to keep the DNS protocol small and lightweight."
  18: "The signatures are stored in a DNS record called an **RRSIG** (Resource Record Signature)."
  19: "And the public key to decrypt that RRSIG record is stored in a new DNS record type called **DNSKEY**."
  20: "Here's how it happens..."
  21: "Some content from the RRset is hashed through a hashing algorithm."
  22: "The result is encrypted with the private section of the zone-signing key creating a RRSIG record."
  23: "Then the authoritative server sends the RRset and the RRSIG to the resolver."
  24: "The resolver takes the RRSet and hashes again, just like the authoritative server did with the same algorithm."
  25: "The resolver decrypts the signature record with the public portion of the zone-signing key into a hash."
  26: "If both hashes match, then the resolver knows that the response is coming from the expected source that hasn't been tampered with."
  27: "A resolver that doesn't support DNSSEC, or is missing the algorithm to support the hashing steps would ignore the signature coming back with the record."
  28: "Here's the current flow when the DNS resolver requests the A record for www.dnsimple.com."
  29: "The authoritative server returns the A record in both an RRset and the RRSIG record."
  30: "The resolver then asks for the DNSKEY record to validate that the requested record is valid and coming from a trusted source."
  31: "The resolver validates the response through the RRset, the RRSIG, and the DNSKEY."
  32: "But what if the DNSKEY was compromised?"

ep3:
  title: "DNSSEC Key-Signing Keys: Extending the Chain of Trust"
  description: "Learn how key-signing keys validate DNSKEY records and strengthen DNSSEC's chain of trust. Explore hierarchical zone relationships, RRSIGs, and how resolvers confirm authenticity in parent-child domains."
  1: "**Key-signing keys** are here to ensure that the DNSKEY can be trusted."
  2: "Key-signing keys validates the DNSKEY record in the same way the zone-signing keys secured the RRsets."
  3: "Here's what we have so far:"
  4: "Records are bundled in RRsets and signed by zone-signing keys. The public portion of that key is stored in a DNSKEY record."
  5: "That DNSKEY record is now signed with a key-signing key creating an additional RRSIG record."
  6: "The public portion of the key-signing key is stored in another DNSKEY record."
  7: "The 2 DNSKEY records are bundled in an RRset that is signed by the private key of the key-signing key."
  8: "Now, when the DNS resolver asks for the DNSKEY, they're going to get an RRset of DNSKEY records along with an RRSIG."
  9: "The process is now as follows..."
  10-1: "The resolver asks the authoritative name server for the A records for www.dnsimple.com."
  10-2: "www.dnsimple.com A record please?"
  11: "The authoritative server returns the RRset containing the A records along with an RRSIG that contains the signature of the zone-signing key."
  12-1: "The resolver queries the authoritative server again for the DNSKEY to validate the signature in the RRSIG record."
  12-2: "DNSKEY, please?"
  13: "The authoritative server returns an RRset containing the DNSKEY for the zone-signing and key-signing keys along with an RRSIG record."
  14: "The resolver now has all the information to validate the DNS query."
  15: "It verifies the RRSIG for the A records in the RRset with the DNSKEY created by the zone-signing key."
  16: "If this is valid, it verifies the RRSIG for the DNSKEY RRset with the DNSKEY created by the key-signing key."
  17: "When all of this is done, the resolver is sure it can trust the values for the A records returned by the authoritative server."
  18: "This is all great, but now we're now facing more issues."
  19: "DNS is hierarchical. Trusting one zone doesn't mean we can trust the parent or the child zone."
  20: "We know we can trust the A records on www.dnsimple.com, but what about the parent and children?"
  21: "The key-signing key is signed by itself. What if it was compromised?"

ep4:
  title: "DNSSEC's Chain of Trust: How the DS Record Connects Parent and Child Zones"
  description: "Learn how DNSSEC uses the DS record to establish trust from parent to child zones. Discover how resolvers validate DNSKEYs, detect tampering, and maintain a secure DNS hierarchy."
  1: "We mentioned that DNS is hierarchical."
  2-1: "When a resolver needs to query the A records for dnsimple.com, it needs to first ask the root where to find the .com servers."
  2-2: "* A character from the comic HowDNS.works"
  3-1: "Then the .com servers will point the resolver to the authoritative name servers for dnsimple.com"
  3-2: "* Another character from the comic HowDNS.works"
  4-1: "Finally, the authoritative server will respond with the IP address for the A records for dnsimple.com."
  4-2: "* Yet another character from the comic HowDNS.works, but you knew that already."
  5: "All of this is based on a **chain of trust**."
  6: "In each iteration with another server, the resolver trusts that it's being redirected from a trusted parent to a trusted child."
  7: "In the DNSSEC world, this is accomplished by a new record type called a **delegation signer** (DS)"
  8: "The DS record is generated on the child zone and given to the parent zone."
  9: "The DS record contains the public portion of the key-signing stored in the DNSKEY record hashed by your DNS provider."
  10: "This DS record needs to be present at the parent zone."
  11: "When the DNS resolver queries the child zone, the parent zone gives the resolver the DS record."
  12: "This serves 2 purposes:"
  13: "First, the resolver is now aware that the child zone is configured with DNSSEC."
  14: "Second, the resolver can check that the unencrypted DS record on the parent zone matches the DNSKEY on the child zone."
  15: "The resolver re-hashes the child's DNSKEY and compares that output to the DS record"
  16: "If they don't match, the resolver knows the zone has been tampered with."
  17: "If they match, the resolver now can trust dnsimple.com"
  18: "We now know that we can trust DNSimple. But what about .com and the root?"

ep5:
  title: "DNSSEC at the Root: Human-Led Signing Ceremonies and the Chain of Trust"
  description: "Discover how the root zone's key-signing ceremony, anchored by real-world humans, secures the entire DNS hierarchy. Learn how DS records, KSKs, and ZSKs together form DNSSEC's unbreakable chain of trust."
  1: "As we travel through the hierarchy of child to parent zones to find out if the DS record is trusted, we'll end up at the top of the hierarchy where no computers are allowed."
  2: "The root zone is the last parent with a DS record."
  3: "The DNSKEY record created by the key-signing key on the root zone is self verified. But who established trust in this record?"
  4: "**HUMANS!**"
  5: "The root signing ceremony is an event where humans come together to celebrate the rotation of the top DNSKEY key and sign it."
  6: "It happens 4 times a year."
  7: "All of this is done in a secure location with a high degree of scrutiny by auditing firms."
  8: "Humans participating in the ceremony can only perform a few actions, ensuring that even if there was a group of evil-doers, they would not be able to compromise the event."
  9: "The result of that ceremony is a **new RRSIG record** that can be used to verify the DNSKEY at the root."
  10: "Let's walk through the chain of trust together, starting at the root."
  11: "When you navigate to dnsimple.com, the DNS resolver will ask the root for the location of the .com server."
  12: "The DNS resolver will assume that the DNSKEY for the key-signing key at the root is trusted because it has been generated by humans."
  13: "Now that we trust the root zone's key (thanks, mysterious humans in the root-signing ceremony!), we can verify .com, then dnsimple.com, and finally www.dnsimple.com"
  14: "If any link in the chain fails, like if a DS record doesn't match the DNSKEY, DNSSEC alerts the resolver."
  15: "The resolver then refuses to pass along the untrusted answer to your device."
  16: "It's basically a big **Access Denied** sign to malicious crabs, tampered-with data, or incompetent villain hackers."
  17: "So that's DNSSEC in a nutshell"
  18: "Zone-signing keys sign the data."
  19: "Key-signing keys sign the zone-signing keys."
  20: "DS records in the parent zone attest to a child zone's authenticity."
  21: "The root zone is validated by real-world humans, ensuring the entire DNS tree is anchored in trust."
  22: "Now that you've seen how it all works, go forth and secure your domains with DNSSEC!"
  23: "The DNS world will be a safer place, no matter how many crabs try to tamper with your traffic!"
